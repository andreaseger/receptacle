    # ensure_method_delegators
    #
    # When using something like `allow(SomeRepo).to receive(:find)` (where find
    # is a mediated method) before the method was called the first time Rspec
    # would stub the method with the wrong arity of 0 when also using jruby.
    # This seems to be caused by the lazily defined methods. Simply calling the
    # following method in a before hook when method stubbing is need solves this
    # issue. As it's a problem which only affects mocking libraries it's
    # currently not planned to change this behavior.
